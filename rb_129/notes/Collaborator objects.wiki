= Collaborator Objects =

A collaborator object is an object that is referenced by an instance variable
from within another class. This collaborator object is part of the state of the
object that references it. Often, instance variables within a class refer to
objects of builtin classes such as String or Integer. These are technically
collaborator objects, however, the term is often reserved for custom classes
that are defined within our program.
