= Class Inheritance =

In Object Oriented Programming, inheritance is the ability of classes to inherit
attributes and behaviors from other classes. This allows programmers to define a
more minimal super-class which can be more frequently reused and then define
subclasses which inherit the behaviors and attributes of the superclass while
adding behaviors specific to that subclass (or sometimes replacing or changing
behavior of the super class.)

A classic example of this would be an `Animal` class.

{{{ruby
class Animal
  def initialize(weight, color)
    @weight = weight
    @color = color
  end
  
  def move
    "I'm moving by "
  end
end

class Turtle
  def initialize(weight, color)
    super
    @in_shell = true
  end
  
  def move
    "#{super} crawling."
  end
  
  def hide_in_shell
    @in_shell = true
  end
  
  def come_out_of_shell
    @in_shell = false
  end
end

class Rabbit
  def initialize(weight, color)
    super
  end
  
  def move
    "#{super} hopping."
  end
end
